# Getting Started

To use the POST method to send a comment,
you need to install a local json-server [JSON-SERVER Docs](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

Install JSON Server:

npm install -g json-server

then, to create a file db.json at the root of the project.

## Starting a local server

### `json-server --watch db.json --port 3004`

Also don't forget to launch the project\*
